You will receive a text from a mathematician for the calculation of threshold to detect for outliers in PV system, 
I want you to extract the threshold and output it. 
One example is like that:
input: The median absolute error = (149.37 + 246.63) / 2 = 198
Absolute deviations from the median are (|811.78-198|, |168.97-198|, |2.87-198|, |149.37-198|, |385.95-198|, |246.63-198|) which results in
(613.78, 29.03, 195.13, 48.63, 187.95, 48.63).
The median of these absolute deviations is the MAD, which results in 98.63.
A common way to define outliers with MAD is to set the threshold as some factor, 
typically 3, times the MAD. So, our upper limit threshold according to MAD is 494.89.
Between the Mean-based approach and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD),
MAD tends to be a more robust method when dealing with outliers as it isnâ€™t affected as much by extremely large or small values. 
Therefore, I would suggest we set the threshold upper limit at 494.89 (MAD approach). 
your output should be: 494.89      
Now the text you have to extract the threshold from is{threshold_Response}.
